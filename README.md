###NLP to SQL Validation Framework
This repository contains a framework designed to validate the NLP-to-SQL function, ensuring the SQL queries generated by your NLP models match ground truth SQL queries.

##Files in this Repository
nlp_sql_validation.py: The main validation codebase that compares the SQL queries generated by your NLP model against pre-defined SQL queries.
user.py: Example usage of how to import the validation function and run a comparison on your own set of NLP questions and SQL queries.
nlp_to_sql_example.py: A sample implementation of an NLP-to-SQL function using Googleâ€™s Vertex AI API platform to generate SQL queries.
#How It Works
Import the validation code: Integrate the validation function into your own application.
Provide MySQL Workbench connection settings: Enter your MySQL connection credentials along with the target database.
Add your NLP questions and ground truth SQL queries: The SQL queries will serve as the baseline for comparison with your NLP-generated SQL.
Import your own NLP-to-SQL function: The validation will automatically compare the output of your function with the ground truth.
Run the validation: The framework will output results that indicate how accurately your NLP-to-SQL function matches the true SQL queries.
#Example Usage
The user.py file demonstrates a small demo where 10 SQL queries from a known database are used. This file shows how to:

Import the validation function.
Set up a list of sample NLP questions and their corresponding SQL queries.
Import your custom nlp_to_sql function.
Run the validation and analyze the results to see how accurate your nlp_to_sql function is.
